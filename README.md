 Repository for Mathematics and Programming for the Quantitative Economist: Volume 1

The book is intended to be used as a main text for Mathematics for Economics courses from introductory to masters levels, and a resource to accompany the main text used in other economics,  econometrics and data science courses.
 It was written for students in the undergraduate and masters level economics programs offered by the School of Economics at Singapore Management University (SMU), especially those pursuing the Quantitative Economics Track and Data Science and Analytics second major at the undergraduate level, and those in or preparing to enter the SMU MSc in Economics and MSc in Financial Economics programs. However, we hope that the material presented here will be useful to economics undergraduates and masters students at other universities as well.
 There are two versions of this book, a web-based version which includes much of the main text and some exercises, but no solutions. The hardcopy version of the book includes the full text, additional exercises, solutions to all exercises, and access to online resources. The hardcopy version of the book is published by World-Scientific and can be purchased from the usual sources. The web-version of the book is freely available to all who wish to use it, as a service to everyone in the learning community. We are grateful to World-Scientific for agreeing to this arrangement.
