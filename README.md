 Repository for Mathematics and Programming for the Quantitative Economist: Volume 1

This book covers mathematics and computer programming at the level required in strong, technically-oriented undergraduate- and masters-level economics programs. It is intended to be used as a main text for Mathematics for Economics courses from introductory to masters levels, and a resource to accompany the main texts used in other economics, econometrics and data science courses. It is the first of two volumes, the second of which will cover mathematics for networks and dynamic models.
 
The book was written for students in the undergraduate and masters level economics programs offered by the School of Economics at the Singapore Management University (SMU), especially those pursuing the Quantitative Economics Track at the undergraduate level, and those in or preparing to enter the SMU MSc in Economics, MSc in Financial Economics and MSc in Data Science in Economics programs. However, we hope that the material presented here will be useful to economics undergraduates and masters students at other universities as well.
